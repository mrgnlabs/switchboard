## Contract

The Switchboard EVM contract implements
[EIP-2535 Diamond Pattern](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2535.md)
to facilitate a modular contract design allowing each module to be updated and
maintained individually. This allows Switchboard's EVM contract to be used
across blockchains with different engineering constraints. Each module is a
facet that can be added to the contract to give it additional functionality.

Switchboard is currently deployed on the following chains. Check out
[The Network](/network) page to see all of the Switchboard supported chains
along with the Switchboard Labs operated queues.

## Getting Started

The [switchboard-xyz/evm-sdk](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/evm-sdk)
contains the EVM specific SDKs and examples for operating Switchboard.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/evm-sdk
```

## Functions

Switchboard Functions allow you to execute your own code off-chain in a
verifiable manner allowing you to build more dynamic programs. This allows you
to publish **_ANY_** data you want on a cron-based schedule, perform basic
maintenance operations, and execute async operations for your users! This lets
you have users interact with your program then perform async checks off-chain to
prevent data staleness and oracle extractable value attacks. Switchboard
Functions are flexible enough for any use case you can imagine without
sacrificing security.

## Data Feeds

Switchboard Data Feeds allow you to permissionless publish a data point on-chain
for use with your smart contracts. These values are published at a periodic
interval such that your users do not need to wait for any off-chain execution in
order to consume the values.
