# Your First Contract

This guide will walk you through creating your first Switchboard x Solidity
contract and walk you through deploying it on a supported EVM chain.

For this guide we'll be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) to debug and
compile our contract, spin up a localnet node, then run custom scripts to deploy
our contract to different chains. You should have NodeJS and npm already
installed - see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for
installation instructions.

## Setup Workspace

We'll start by cloning
[Hardhat's Boilerplate Project](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/boilerplate-project)
to get us up and running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-boilerplate my-first-contract
cd my-first-contract
npm install
```

You should have the following folder structure:

<Grid container spacing={2}   justifyContent="flex-start" alignItems="flex-start">
<Grid item xs={12} md={4}>
<Box>

```
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── contracts
│   └── Token.sol
├── frontend/
├── hardhat.config.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── scripts
│   └── deploy.js
├── tasks
│   └── faucet.js
└── test
    └── Token.js
```

</Box>
</Grid>
<Grid item xs={12} md={8}>

- **`contracts/Token.sol`** - This is our Solidity contract
- **`frontend`** - This is a sample frontend dApp to interact with our contract.
  We'll be ignoring it for this guide.
- **`hardhat.config.js`** - This is the configuration file for Hardhat which is
  responsible for compiling our Solidity contract into bytecode and also has
  some helpful functionality to run custom tasks and interact with our contract.
- **`scripts/deploy.js`** - This is a Hardhat script to deploy our contract to
  an EVM network.
- **`tasks/faucet.js`** - This is a custom hardhat task we can run with
  `npx hardhat faucet`
- **`test/Token.js`** - This is a javascript test module to interact with our
  contract and test its functionality from a client-side application.

</Grid>
</Grid>

Now let's add the Switchboard dependencies.

```bash
npm i -D @switchboard-xyz/evm.js
```

Now run `npx hardhat compile` to compile the sample contract. You should see two
new directories `artifacts` and `cache`.

So now we have our workspace setup with the Switchboard dependency added, so
lets write a Solidity contract!

## Solidity Contract

We are going to write a Solidity contract which reads an existing Switchboard
data feed.

Then let's add the following line to our Solidity contract
`contracts/Token.sol`:

```diff
//SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

// Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
// It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

+ // Add the Switchboard data feed interface
+ import {Switchboard} from "@switchboard-xyz/evm.js/contracts/core/testnet/Switchboard.sol";

// We import this library to be able to use console.log
import "hardhat/console.sol";
```
