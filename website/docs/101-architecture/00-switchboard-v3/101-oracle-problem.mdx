The oracle problem arises due to the inability of blockchains to interact 
directly with external systems. Blockchains are isolated networks that only 
rely on data stored in their ledger for consensus. The deterministic nature 
of smart contracts is a result of the narrow focus of blockchain consensus 
and their ability to execute exactly as written with a higher degree of 
certainty than traditional systems. Incorrect reporting of external data can 
lead to devastating outcomes for on-chain applications dependent on it.

### Evolution of Oracle Systems

| Type of Oracle           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Security                                                                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trusted Signer           | The first iteration of oracles used a trusted signer to update a price account on-chain. This model is vulnerable to a single keypair leak to pwn the entire system and should never be considered.                                        | Oracle does not need to collude and does not have any form of validation.                             |
| Multi-Party Consensus    | Multiple oracles are polled and the final result is determined from the median of the responses.                                                                                                                                           | Oracles have no incentive to report honestly.                                                         |
| Stake-Weighted Consensus | Stake is required to participate and oracles lose their stake for acting maliciously. Almost there! This system will naturally imbalance as the opportunity cost of acting maliciously outweighs the slashing penalty.                     | High infrastructure cost and misalignment of incentives when cost of attack exceeds slashing penalty. |

### Switchboard V3

Switchboard addresses the oracle problem by utilizing the following to develop 
our latest V3 iteration.

  <SimpleCard title="Trusted Execution Environments" content="The TEE technology (such as IntelSGX) is utilized to enforce all oracles are operated within a secure enclave. TEEs generate a quote that the software of the oracle and its executions weren't tampered with. Essentially, code is law." />
  <SimpleCard title="Economic Incentives" content="Oracles must have a minimum stake to join the network and get rewarded for honest reporting. Oracles who fail to respond or respond incorrectly will be slashed and lose part of their stake to incentivize honest behavior." />
  <SimpleCard title="Independent Queues" content="Oracles join a set queue which defines the security settings of its compute network. The queue authority could be controlled by a DAO creating an autonomous compute network governed by its participants. The queue controls the reward and slashing behavior to entice new oracles to join the network during congestion." />
  <SimpleCard title="Developer First" content="Switchboard is built to be a permissionless, customizable network where developers can define their own solutions such as creating a data feed, writing a function, etc tailored to the protocol's exact needs. However, other oracle systems do not allow for permissionless definitions of your solution." />
