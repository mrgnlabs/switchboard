Welcome to the Switchboard Documentation. You'll find comprehensive product
guides, various examples and API references to help you build inspiring projects
with Switchboard's products.

## Introduction

In the traditional context of a switchboard, it is widely used in
telecommunication infrastructures to manually establish connections to
facilitate information flow between parties. Similarly, Switchboard, the oracle
protocol, employs a decentralized quorum of oracles to shuffle data on a
blockchain, empowering smart contract developers to build upon and utilize. The
latest iteration, Switchboard V3 is the next-gen oracle, introducing a new
paradigm of how and what oracle infrastructures can provide to blockchain
developers.

### What is Switchboard V3?

Traditional oracles are limited to quantitative value reporting. Switchboard
goes beyond, providing a general purpose compute layer for you to build
serverless functions and delegate the off-chain compute and verification to our
network of oracles.

| Traditional Oracles                          | Switchboard                                                                       |

| Whitelisted nodes or economic staking        | TEE nodes and economic staking                                                    |
| Limited to only quantitative value reporting | Ability to execute off-chain computes verifiably and submit transactions on-chain |
| Opaque source of information                 | Transparent function source code and logs readily available                       |
| Single method of data propagation            | Multiple methods such as push (cron schedule) and callback based                  |
| Huge upfront cost to list new price feeds    | Pay as you go and permissionless creation of new functions                        |

### How does Switchboard V3 work?

Switchboard provides verifiable computation with the use of Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs). A TEE is a secure area within a device's hardware or
software that isolates sensitive data and code from the rest of the system.
Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a hardware-based technology that
provides TEE capabilities. Switchboard leverages SGX to run a user's custom code
within its own SGX runtime and provides the attestation service to verify
on-chain that the quote generated from the executed code matches the expected
measurement set by the user on-chain with their `MRENCLAVE` value.
