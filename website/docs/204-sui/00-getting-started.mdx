## Getting Started

The [switchboard-xyz/sui-sdk](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sui-sdk)
contains the Sui specific SDKs and examples for operating Switchboard.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sui-sdk
```

## Data Feeds

Switchboard Data Feeds allow you to permissionless publish a data point on-chain
for use with your smart contracts. These values are published at a periodic
interval such that your users do not need to wait for any off-chain execution in
order to consume the values.
