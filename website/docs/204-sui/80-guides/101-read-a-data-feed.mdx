# Read a Data Feed On-Chain

> An example contract reading the price of a Switchboard V2 data feed on-chain.

Clone the example:

```bash
https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sui-sdk switchboard-sui-sdk
cd switchboard-sui-sdk
cd programs/mainnet/feed-parser
```

Then build the example program

```bash
sui move compile
```

Then publish the module on-chain. We'll skip dependency verification because
we're only pulling in a binding (not the full source).

```bash
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```
