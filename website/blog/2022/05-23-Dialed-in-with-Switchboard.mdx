# Dialed in with Switchboard: 5–23–22

## Switchboard V2 SDK is Here!

[**github.com/switchboard-xyz/switchboard-v2**](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/switchboard-v2)

The Switchboard V2 SDK is here and includes the necessary tools to help you
integrate Switchboard into your on-or-off chain applications. The SDK includes
libraries for Typescript/Javascript, Python, and Rust, as well as example
programs demonstrating how to read and interact with Switchboard V2. Below is
the current overview of the Github repo structure:

### Setup

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/switchboard-v2.git](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/switchboard-v2.git) && cd switchboard-v2
```

Then, install and link the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
yarn workspaces run build
yarn workspace @switchboard-xyz/switchboardv2-cli link
anchor build && node ./scripts/setup-example-programs.js
```

Finally, test the example programs

```bash
anchor test
```

### Localnet Integration

The SDK supports copying a Switchboard devnet environment to your localnet
environment for integration testing. This is useful if you want to see how your
program will react to Switchboard data feed updates.

First, change the cluster to localnet in Anchor.toml.

Next, create a Switchboard devnet queue and oracle.

```bash
sbv2 localnet:env --keypair ../payer-keypair.json -o .switchboard
```

This command will output:

- **start-local-validator.sh**: starts a local Solana validator with the
  Switchboard program, IDL, and our devnet environment pre-loaded

- **start-oracle.sh**: start a Switchboard oracle and start heartbeating on the
  localnet queue

- **docker-compose.yml**: docker file with the Switchboard oracle environment

- **switchboard.env**: contains your Switchboard accounts

In three separate shells, run the following commands in this order:

- .switchboard/start-local-validator.sh

- .switchboard/start-oracle.sh

- anchor test --skip-local-validator

The anchor tests are configured to first fetch the account info for the
Switchboard DAO controlled devnet permissionless queue. If the account info is
not found, it assumes a localnet connection and looks for the switchboard.env
with your Switchboard environment specific public keys. If a .switchboard
directory or switchboard.env file is not found in the root project directory, it
will look 2 levels higher until giving up.

## Uniswap & SushiSwap Task Types

Switchboard has added the
[UniswapExchangeRateTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#uniswapexchangeratetask)
and
[SushiSwapExchangeRateTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#sushiswapexchangeratetask)
to resolve the swap price of assets on Uniswap and SushiSwap. These new task
types will allow Solana protocols to offer DeFi products using data sourced from
Ethereum.

## xStepPriceTask

Switchboard also ported over the [xStepPriceTask](http://xsteppricetask) from
Switchboard V1 to Switchboard V2. The following is an example of how to use the
new task type:

## SplTokenParseTask & SplStakePoolTask

Switchboard has added the
[SplTokenParseTask](https://gist.github.com/gallynaut/1414b538090e29fe598ef4186445de0d)
and [SplStakePoolTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#splstakepooltask)
to resolve on-chain data in your Switchboard feeds. This will allow developers
to build data feeds using live on-chain data. The following is an example of how
to fetch the total token supply of the MonkeeDao stake pool:
