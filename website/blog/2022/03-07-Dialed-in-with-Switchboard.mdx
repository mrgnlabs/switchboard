# Dialed in with Switchboard: Vol. 1

> Dialed in with Switchboard will be a weekly newsletter about the various
> on-going updates with Switchboard.

## Lending Rate Task

Last week Switchboard implemented the
[lendingRateTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#lendingratetask) thanks
to the work of JetLabs with their
[@jet-lab/defi-yield-ts](https://github.com/jet-lab/defi-yield-ts) library.
Developers can now source lending and borrowing rates for the top Solana lending
protocols on-chain, opening the doors to new automated yield lending strategies.

Check out
[Switchboard’s Job Directory](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/job-directory#lending-rates)
for some examples on how to use this new task. Also view the protobuf schema for
[lendingRateTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#lendingratetask).

## Mango Perps Task

Switchboard also added the
[mangoPerpMarketTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#mangoperpmarkettask)
to resolve the current price of perpetual markets on mango. This can be combined
with the twapTask to track the time weighted average price of a mango perp
market and build automated strategies around it.

Check out
[Switchboard’s Job Directory](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/job-directory#mango-perps)
for some examples. You can find Mango Market’s addresses in their
[@blockworks-foundation/mango-client-v3](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-client-v3/blob/main/src/ids.json)
repo.

## Variance Threshold added to Publisher

The [Publisher](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/publisher) was updated to allow a
configurable variance threshold field. The
[varianceThreshold](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/architecture/feeds#aggregatoraccountdata)
dictates the change percentage required before an oracle reports a result
on-chain. A Switchboard data feed includes a pre-funded escrow to reward oracles
for each successful update. The varianceThreshold is a cost saving parameter to
reduce excessive on-chain updates and extend the life of a feed. If an oracle
resolves a value that is too similar to the last reported value, the oracle
skips reporting a result and conserves the feed’s escrow. Note, some feeds may
require the most up-to-date data so it is left up to the publisher based on
their use case.

## Query Aggregator History On-Chain

The [switchboard-v2](https://docs.rs/switchboard-v2) crate was updated to 0.1.8,
which updates the anchor dependency to 0.22 and added the ability to query an
aggregator’s history buffer on-chain. An aggregator can be configured to store
the last N results on-chain in a
[history buffer account](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/architecture/feeds/history).
The rust crate now lets you query a history buffer and return the previous
results value and timestamp. You can add a history buffer to your data feed
using the Publisher on the
[Explorer App](https://app.switchboard.xyz).

## VRF CPI Example

The
[@switchboard-xyz/vrf-cpi-example](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/vrf-cpi-example)
was updated to show how a Program Derived Address (PDA) can be used as a VRF
Account’s authority and sign requestRandomness instructions on its behalf. This
allows VRF Accounts to be controlled by a program and have predefined update
logic.

## Switchboard V2 CLI

The
[@switchboard-xyz/switchboardv2-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@switchboard-xyz/switchboardv2-cli)
was updated to support account deserialization on devnet and mainnet for
convenient debugging. Once installed, run the command `sbv2 print PUBLICKEY`
where PUBLICKEY is any switchboard account, and the CLI will output the
deserialized account.
